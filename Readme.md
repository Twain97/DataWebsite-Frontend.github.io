Hi! My name is Akinpelumi Taiwo (aka Twain97) a self learner of web design, 

this is a Data subscription e-commerce website 

It was designed with pure html, css and javascript

I want to create a backend for it to accept, store user data and create user profile

I was thinking of setting it up with node and sql, but im having a hard time understanding them

Do you think it will be ok if i use firebase for that?
